# Task 1
Your task is to guess the password and obtain the secret key.

## Instructions
1. Clone this repository (`git clone https://github.com/ossm-cs/password-breaker`), if you haven't already.
2. Navigate to this folder in your file explorer (`cd password-breaker/task-1` command line)
3. Open `very-insecure-website.html` using a web browser. I recommend you use Google Chrome. There are better browsers, but for our purposes it will work.
4. Guess the password and find the secret key! You're going to need to poke around on the website a bit.

## Solution
Come and find me to verify your secret key. "Sorry, that's not the right password." is **not** the key.

***SPOILER ALERT SPOILER ALERT***
## Hints
Try to solve it yourself first. If you're really stuck:

1. Poking around on a website is how you look for intrusion points. How might you closely examine the content of this website?
2. Google Chrome has developer tools. To open them, press `F12` or right-click > Inspect Element.
3. This website is powered by Java**Script**.
