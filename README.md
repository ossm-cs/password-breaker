# password-breaker
This repository is designed to be a *very* simple demonstration of
1. A brute-force password attack
2. A dictionary attack

While this could *technically* be used to break someone's password, even such a basic defence as a CAPTCHA should render this ineffective.

## Instructions
After you clone this repo, go through the folders in order. There should be more information there.

## Structure
This repository is also going to double as an example of a basic repo, so you should take note of the file structure.

- `src/`: all of the code that we write. The **source** files.
- - `main/`: the code that we execute; the main program. Everything that's not a test file.
- - - `java/`: java code
- - - `scripts/`: javascript code (unrelated to java)
- - - `python/`: python code. Do you see the pattern?
- - `test/`: we write *tests* to help guard against logical errors when we change the code.
- `documentation/`: sometimes, to explain our code, it's helpful to have a documentation folder, in addition to the README.
- `README.md`: an overview of the repository. Usually contains installation instructions, as well.
- `LICENSE`: what license the code is licensed under. Our code will be licensed under the [MIT License](LICENSE).
- `CONTRIBUTING.md`: guidelines for contributing.
- `.gitignore`: these files will not be pushed to the master repo.
